\item{Y}{Observation matrix.}

\item{A}{Covariate matrix.}

\item{Q}{Vector of ranks to evaluate (e.g., 1:5).}

\item{div}{Number of folds (default: 5).}

\item{seed}{Integer seed for reproducibility.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link{nmfkc}} (e.g., \code{method="EU"}).}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\item{objfunc}{Numeric vector containing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for each Q.}
\item{sigma}{Numeric vector containing the Residual Standard Error (RMSE) for each Q. Only available if method="EU".}
\item{objfunc.fold}{List of length equal to Q. Each element contains the MSE values for the k folds.}
\item{folds}{A list of length \code{div}, containing the linear indices of held-out elements for each fold (shared across all Q).}

\description{
\code{nmfkc.ecv} performs k-fold cross-validation by randomly holding out
individual elements of the data matrix (element-wise), assigning them a
weight of 0 via \code{Y.weights}, and evaluating the reconstruction error on
those held-out elements.

This method (also known as Wold's CV) is theoretically robust for determining
the optimal rank (Q) in NMF. This function supports vector input for \code{Q},
allowing simultaneous evaluation of multiple ranks on the same folds.
