\usage{
nmfkc.residual.plot(
  Y,
  result,
  Y_XB_palette = (grDevices::colorRampPalette(c("white", "orange", "red")))(256),
  E_palette = (grDevices::colorRampPalette(c("blue", "white", "red")))(256),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{The original observation matrix (P x N).}

\item{result}{The result object returned by the nmfkc function.}

\item{Y_XB_palette}{A vector of colors used for Y and XB heatmaps. Defaults to a white-orange-red gradient.}

\item{E_palette}{A vector of colors used for the residuals (E) heatmap. Defaults to a blue-white-red gradient.}

\item{...}{Additional graphical parameters passed to the internal image calls.}
}
\value{
NULL. The function generates a plot.

\description{
This function generates a side-by-side plot of three heatmaps: the original
observation matrix Y, the fitted matrix XB (from NMF), and the residual matrix E (Y - XB).
This visualization aids in diagnosing whether the chosen rank Q is adequate
by assessing if the residual matrix E appears to be random noise.

The axis labels (X-axis: Samples, Y-axis: Features) are integrated into the main title of each plot
to maximize the plot area, reflecting the compact layout settings.
