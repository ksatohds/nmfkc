Description: The goal of nmfkcreg is to perform NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization)  kernel covariate regression model described by Y~XCA
 where observation matrix Y(P,N),
 kernel matrix A(N,N) with parameter beta,
 basis matrix X(P,Q) whose column sum is 1 and Q<=P
 and coefficient matrix C(Q,N).
 Note that Y and A are known, and X and C are unknown.
