Description: The goal of the package is to perform Non-negative Matrix Factorization
 kernel covariate regression model. It optimizes basis matrix and parameter matrix
 where observation matrix and kernel matrix are given.
 In particular, if the kernel matrix is a unit matrix, it can be used as an ordinary non-negative matrix factorization.
